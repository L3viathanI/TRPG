# TRPG
 An RPG Manager I made as my Boost Hacks Project
 
 The backend works with 4 major classes: the attributes, the actions, the entities and the rpg itself.

 Attributes are the basic units of data, containing their name and the type of data they should represent. The data types are alphanumeric, numeric and boolean, but I represent them in my project as "alpha", "num" and "bool" respectively.

 Actions are the means for attribute values to be changed between entities. They contain their name and the effects they bring about when used.

 The frontend was made in PyQt the Python wrapper for Qt. Thought the GUI is not yet fully complete.

 Everything is saved in .json files.
